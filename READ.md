My-First-Blog
=============

# Introduction

This is my first Django project. My goal is to learn more about building a simple blog. It contains code that I have written based on the DjangoGirls Tutorial found here: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_start_project/ .

# Setup

First a virtual environment is created in my home directory and Django is installed.

# Branches

I created 2 branches within my project. The master was the original, and my working-branch was created to better test features before pulling into the master.
